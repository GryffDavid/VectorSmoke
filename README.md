## Vector Smoke ##
I loved this cool smoke effect created by [Jason Keyser](https://www.keyserhouse.com/).

But I'm not an animator and I couldn't afford the effect as my budget for my game was $0. So I attempted to recreate something in a similar style. The added benefit of doing it programmatically is that the smoke can react in real-time to other elements in the game such as explosions or an entity walking through it, as well as attaching the base of the smoke to a moving object and having it leave an accurate trail behind. The parameters of how the smoke moves and how many vertices make up the smoke can easily be tuned too. Originally written in November 2016.
